# AI Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on demographic and usage data. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, the model identifies individuals who are likely to leave a service, helping organizations take proactive measures.

The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.
- **Modeling**: Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on historical data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedabdullah111/Customer_Churn_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook and run the cells to train the model.
